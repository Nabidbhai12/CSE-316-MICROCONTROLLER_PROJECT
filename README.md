# CSE-316-MICROCONTROLLER_PROJECT

# **`Home Secuirty System`**

Therefore, the goal of our Project was to develop a home security system that essentially demonstrates how to use micro-controller devices to provide a safe home.

We used Arduino Uno and esp-32 as micro-controllers. To see our project's motivation and scope
